If the AR Pipeline helped you see how the show flows from start to finish, the Scene Hierarchy lets you step closer and see who stands where and how they’re connected.\n\nI designed this diagram to make sense of how objects are arranged and updated inside a Lens Studio scene.\n\nPicture the scene as the entire stage. Everything in the AR lens lives under this root.\n\n**Camera**\n\nYour audience’s viewpoint—the camera determines what’s rendered.\n\n**Lights**\n\nStage lighting that gives objects depth, shadow, and realism.\n\n**Anchors**\n\nMarkers that track positions like face or world surfaces; they define where actions happen.\n\nAnchors feed into **landmarks**, which track detailed points such as eyes, nose, or mouth. Attached props—like glasses or hats—move naturally because they inherit these transformations.\n\n**Attached Objects**\n\nThese are your actors and props:\n- glasses meshes\n- hats or rigged models\n- face effects and materials\n\n**Materials & VFX**\n\nThese define how things actually look—textures, shaders, blends, particles.\n\n**Why it Matters**\n\n It can be daunting looking into the barrel of your AR engine at times. What do are all these properties for? Understanding the underlying model can help make this tool feel less confusing."
